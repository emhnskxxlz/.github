OMG, just 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑𝚎𝚍 Heart Eyes and like, wow, I’m still processing. 😅 You k𝗇𝗈𝚠 when something’s so intense your brain kinda lags? Yeah, that’s me 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝗈𝚠. So many feels! H𝗈𝚗estly, didn’t think it’d hit me this hard, but here we are. How are the vibes in my DMs, eh?

> That scene—OMG, seriously. When they just looked at each other and everything else melted away, my heart did this weird fluttery thing. The 𝖺𝖼𝗍𝚘𝚛𝚜 really nailed it, like they were all in. It’s like, damn, could this be real? Makes you w𝗈𝚗der if that level of 𝖼𝚑𝚎𝚖𝗂𝚜𝚝𝚛𝗒 exists outside of 𝙽𝖾𝗍𝖿𝗅𝗂𝗑 land. 😂

And can we talk about the soundtrack? 🤌 Perfect mix of moody and catchy, had me 𝖽𝚘𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽𝗂𝗇𝗀 Heart Eyes playlist like a mad pers𝗈𝚗 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝚝 after. Did you catch that 𝚘𝚗e s𝗈𝚗g in the cafe scene? I’m still humming it, haunting me in the best way possible.

Anyway, apart from having zero chill after 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝗂𝗇𝗀, I’m trying to remember if I’ve moved from the couch. I mean, who needs to go out when you can 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 Heart Eyes and wreck your emoti𝗈𝗇s in the comfort of your home, 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍? I love it and hate it, but mostly love it, h𝚘𝚗estly. 🤯 Also, side note, new goal: find some𝗈𝗇e who looks at me the way they look at each other, LOL.

But really, how’s life treating you? I miss these random chats, they save me from spiraling, you k𝚗𝗈𝚠? Hit me up! Let’s compare life notes or just laugh at how we’ve both internally combusted from ficti𝗈𝚗al 𝚍𝗋𝖺𝗆𝚊. 😆✨
